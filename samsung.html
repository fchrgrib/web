  <h2>Product Description</h2>
  <p>Overall, the Galaxy A70 performs well with its octa-core processor. 
      The smartphone gives you enough processing power for all your 
      daily needs and some gaming. We were able to use the phone all day 
      without any hiccups or lagging. One of the most disappointing 
      features of the A70 is its camera. While you’ll still be 
      able to capture decent photos using the three rear cameras, 
      we found that the end results lacked in detail and crispness 
      we were able to see on other cameras on our list. Overall, 
      the Samsung Galaxy A70 is an excellent choice for anyone looking 
      specifically for Samsung smartphones.</p>
